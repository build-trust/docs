The core of any agent is its model. Models are AI systems that transform input data into useful language outputs. They can understand natural language, reason about context, and generate text, powering the capabilities of [Ockam Agents](/agents/agents).

If no model is explicitly defined an agent will default to using the `llama3.2` model. You can specify any model you prefer by passing the `model` argument to `Agent.start()`:

```python images/main/main.py
from ockam import Agent, Model, Node, Repl
from sys import argv


async def main(node):
    agent = await Agent.start(
        node=node,
        instructions="You are Henry, an expert legal assistant",
        model=Model("claude-3-7-sonnet-v1"),
    )

    await Repl.start(agent, argv[1])


Node.start(main)
```

The code above changes the agent to use the `claude-3-7-sonnet-v1` model. To use `deepseek-r1` change the model to:

```python images/main/main.py
from ockam import Agent, Model, Node, Repl
from sys import argv


async def main(node):
    agent = await Agent.start(
        node=node,
        instructions="You are Henry, an expert legal assistant",
        model=Model("deepseek-r1"),
    )

    await Repl.start(agent, argv[1])


Node.start(main)
```

The complete list of currently supported models is:

* `claude-3-7-sonnet-v1`
* `deepseek-r1`
* `nova-micro-v1`
