<Steps>
  <Step title="Install">
    Install the `ockam` command by running the following in your terminal.

    ```bash
    curl -sSfL install.command.ockam.io | bash && source "$HOME/.ockam/env"
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy your first agent">
    ```bash
    mkdir hello && cd hello && ockam
    ```

    When run in an empty directory, the `ockam` command sets up a brand new app and creates a production-ready deployment zone on our serverless runtime.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Chat with your agent">

    The "hello world" app includes an interactive [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) for interacting with your agent:
    
    ```
    Welcome to Ockam ðŸ‘‹
    
    You are connected to your agent - 782844ce-hello-main/545107ca
    Ask it a question or give it a task.
    
    Type ':help' or ':h' to see this message again.
    Type ':quit' or ':q' to disconnect.
    
    > 
    ```

    This agent runs on Ockam's serverless runtime. The REPL you access on your local machine runs in the cloud, and you connect to it over a secure & private connection using Ockam's messaging protocols.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Send">
    Type your instructions and press `[ENTER]` to interact with the agent:
    ```
    > Tell me a tale
    ```
  </Step>

## The generated code

Within the `hello` directory, `ockam` has created a new project with several files:

- A `README.md` with information about your project
- An `ockam.yaml` configuration file that defines how your agent should be deployed
- An `images` directory containing the agent's source code:
  - `main.py` - The Python code that powers your agent
  - `Dockerfile` - Instructions for building the agent's container
  - `requirements.txt` - Python package dependencies
  - `README.md` - Documentation specific to the agent implementation

```bash Generated Files
Â» tree

â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ ockam.yaml
â””â”€â”€ images
    â””â”€â”€ main
        â”œâ”€â”€ Dockerfile
        â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
        â”œâ”€â”€ main.py
        â””â”€â”€ requirements.txt
```

Let's examine these files:

The `main.py` file contains the core logic for your agent. It uses Ockam's Python SDK to:

1. Create a node that can communicate using Ockam's messaging protocols
2. Start an agent with a specific prompt ("You are Jack Sparrow")
3. Launch a REPL (interactive shell) that connects to this agent



```python images/main/main.py
from ockam import Agent, Node, Repl
from sys import argv


async def main(node):
    agent = await Agent.start(node, "You are Jack Sparrow.")
    await Repl.start(agent, argv[1])


Node.start(main)
```

The `ockam.yaml` configuration file defines how to deploy your agent:

- Creates a zone named `hello`
- Creates a pod named `main-pod`
- Runs a container using the `main` image (built from your Python code)
- Sets up a portal outlet that will allow other nodes to communicate on port 
`9000`


```yaml ockam.yaml
name: hello
pods:
  - name: main-pod
    containers:
      - name: main
        image: main
        args: [localhost:9000]
    portals:
      outlets:
        - to: localhost:9000
```


When you run `ockam`, it:

1. Builds your Python code into a container image
2. Deploys the container according to the `ockam.yaml` configuration
3. Opens a portal inlet on your local workstation that connects to the outlet on the agent's container
4. Connects to the agent's REPL over the secure portal

## Customize the agent

```python images/main/main.py
from ockam import Agent, Node, Repl
from sys import argv


async def main(node):
    agent = await Agent.start(node, "You are Henry, an expert legal assistant")
    await Repl.start(agent, argv[1])


Node.start(main)
```

Deploy again

```bash
ockam
```

## Start the http api

```python
from ockam import Agent, HttpServer, Model, Node, Repl
from sys import argv


async def main(node):
    agent = await Agent.start(
        node=node,
        name="henry",
        instructions="You are Henry, an expert legal assistant",
        model=Model("deepseek-r1"),
    )

    await Repl.start(agent, argv[1])


Node.start(main, http_server=HttpServer(listen_address=argv[2]))
```

```yaml
name: example05
pods:
  - name: main-pod
    containers:
      - name: main
        image: main
        args: [localhost:9000, localhost:9001]
    portals:
      outlets:
        - name: repl
          to: localhost:9000
        - name: http
          to: localhost:9001
```
