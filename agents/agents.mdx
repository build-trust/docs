Ockam agents can break down complex queries  into detailed plans using reasoning models. Then execute the plan, step by step, using various tools at their disposal:

- LLMs to access general knowledge and language capabilities.
- Knowledge databases to augment LLMs with private or expert data.
- Tools to query remote systems.
- Memory to keep track of conversations and support durable processes.
- Other Ockam agents to distribute tasks in order to scale with the amount of work to be done.
