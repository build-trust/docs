Ockam Agents are autonomous actors that accomplish complex open ended tasks. Python apps, running in Ockam AI, can create millions of parallel collaborating agents. Each agent:

- Has a unique identity.
- Uses a large language [model](/agents/models) to understand natual language.
- Has [memory](/agents/memory) of conversations.
- Makes [plans](/agents/planning) that break down complex tasks into small iterative steps.
- Can retrieve [knowledge](/agents/knowledge) beyond the training data of its language model.
- Invokes [tools](/agents/tools) to gather new information and take actions.
- Collaborates with and can delegate work to other agents.

<RequestExample>

```python images/main/main.py
from ockam import Agent, Node


async def main(node):
    await Agent.start(
        node=node,
        name="henry",
        instructions="""
            You are Henry, an expert legal assistant.
        """
    )


Node.start(main)
```

<Tip>
  You can find all the code for the following example [on Github](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/tree/develop/examples/001).
</Tip>

Let’s build and deploy a new app, that provides a Legal AI Agent. Within the app directory, create the following files:

```bash app
» tree

├── ockam.yaml
└── images
    └── main
        ├── Dockerfile
        └── main.py
```

- The `ockam.yaml` configuration file defines how to deploy your zone.
- The `images` directory contains the source code of docker images.
  - Inside it, there is a directory for the `main` image.
    - `Dockerfile` describe how the main image will be compiled.
    - `main.py` is the Python program that is run by the main image.

Let’s define them one by one:

```yaml ockam.yaml
name: 01
pods:
  - name: main-pod
    public: true
    containers:
      - name: main
        image: main
```

The `ockam.yaml` configuration file defines how to deploy your app:

- Create a zone named `01` .
- Create a pod named `main-pod`inside the `01` zone.
- Make the pod public.
- Run a `main` container using the `main` image.

```bash images/main/Dockerfile
FROM ghcr.io/build-trust/ockam-python:latest
COPY . .
ENTRYPOINT ["python", "main.py"]
```

The `Dockerfile` bases the `main` image on the `ockam-python` image with already contains the `ockam` python package. The `Dockerfile` then copies the contents of the `images/main` directory into the image and runs the `main.py` python program.

```python images/main/main.py
from ockam import Agent, Node


async def main(node):
    await Agent.start(
        node=node,
        name="henry",
        instructions="""
            You are Henry, an expert legal assistant.
        """
    )


Node.start(main)
```

The `main.py` file contains the core logic for your app. It uses the `ockam` python package to:

1. Start a Node that will invoke the `main` function after initialization.
2. The main function start an agent on that node with specific instructions.
3. The agent is named `henry`.

The Node by default, also starts an HTTP server.

<Note>
  Ensure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) installed and running on your workstation before running the `ockam` command.
</Note>

When you run `ockam`, it:

1. Builds the code in `images/main` into a container image and pushes that image to your Zone.
2. Deploys the Zone into your Cluster based on the configuration in `ockam.yaml`.
3. Opens two portal inlets on your local workstation that connect to outlets in the `main-pod`.

```
. Deploying zone 01 in cluster 25df35de87aa441b88f22a6c2a830a17...

✔ Created a repository for the image main
✔ Built image main
✔ Pushed image main

✔ Deployed zone 01 in cluster 25df35de87aa441b88f22a6c2a830a17

  The http server on the main-pod is available at:
  https://25df35de87aa441b88f22a6c2a830a17-01.ai.ockam.network

✔ Opened a portal to the outlet http on main-pod from tcp://localhost:8000
✔ Opened a portal to the outlet logs on logs-pod from tcp://localhost:3000
```

## Arguments

- `name`
- `node`
- `instructions`
- `model`
- `knowledge`
- `tools`
- `planner`

### Instance arguments

- `prompt`
- `scope`
- `conversation`

## Logs

You can see the logs of your running python app on `http://localhost:3000/logs/explorer` .

## HTTP Server

By default the pod will expose a HTTP interface with a few endpoints interact with the deployed agents.

### List agents

The public URL for the HTTP server on your pod (each pod will have its own unique URL) is displayed in the example output above:

> The http server on the main-pod is available at:
> https://25df35de87aa441b88f22a6c2a830a17-01.ai.ockam.network

To return a list of all agents running on that pod send a `GET` request to the `/agents` endpoint:

<CodeGroup>

```bash httpie
http GET \
"https://25df35de87aa441b88f22a6c2a830a17-01.ai.ockam.network/agents"
```


```bash curl
curl --request GET \
"https://25df35de87aa441b88f22a6c2a830a17-01.ai.ockam.network/agents"
```

</CodeGroup>

```json response
{
    "agents": [
        {
            "description": [],
            "is_remote": false,
            "name": "henry",
            "workers": []
        }
    ]
}
```

### Send prompt to agent

To interact with a specific agent, send a `POST` request to the `/agents/<name>` endpoint:

<CodeGroup>

```bash httpie
http POST \
  "https://25df35de87aa441b88f22a6c2a830a17-example001.ai.ockam.network/agents/henry" \
  message="who are you?"
```


```bash curl
curl --request POST \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"message":"who are you?"}' \
  "https://25df35de87aa441b88f22a6c2a830a17-example001.ai.ockam.network/agents/henry"
```

</CodeGroup>

```json response

[
    {
        "content": "My name is Henry, and I'm an expert legal assistant. I have extensive knowledge and experience in various aspects of law, including but not limited to, contract law, tort law, family law, employment law, and more. I can provide guidance on legal procedures, help with document preparation, and offer insights into different legal scenarios.\n\nWhile I'm not a licensed attorney, I can assist with general inquiries, provide information on legal concepts, and help navigate the complexities of the law. If you have a specific legal issue or concern, I'll do my best to provide you with helpful information and point you in the right direction.\n\nWhat can I help you with today?",
        "role": "assistant",
        "tool_calls": []
    }
]
```

### Send prompt to agent (\+ stream response)

For some use cases, especially user-facing ones with potentially long responses, it may be preferable to stream the response. Passing a `stream=true` parameter to the `/agents/<name>` endpoint will stream chunked responses from the agent in real-time:

<CodeGroup>

```bash httpie
http POST \
"https://25df35de87aa441b88f22a6c2a830a17-01.ai.ockam.network/agents/henry?stream=true" \
message="what is a patent"
```


```bash curl
curl --request POST \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data '{"message": "what is a patent"}' \
"https://25df35de87aa441b88f22a6c2a830a17-01.ai.ockam.network/agents/henry?stream=true"
```

</CodeGroup>
