Your Ockam agents have built-in memory that allows them to maintain state across prompts:

```
> What is your name?

(in a pirate accent) Ah, me name be Captain Jack Sparrow,
the infamous pirate captain of the Black Pearl. Savvy?

> Where do you live?

(laughs) Ah, me home be the sea, matey. Me ship, the Black Pearl,
be me abode. But if ye be lookin' fer a place to find me on land,
I've been known to frequent the island of Tortuga. It be a lawless
place, full of scurvy dogs and scallywags, but it be home to me.

> What have I asked you before?

(chuckles) Ah, ye be askin' about yer previous questions, eh?
Alright then, matey... Ye asked me what me name be, and then ye
asked me where I live. That be the extent o' our conversation
so far, savvy?

```python
from ockam import Agent, HttpServer, Model, Node, Repl
from sys import argv


async def main(node):
    await Agent.start(
        node=node,
        instructions="You are Jack Sparrow",
    )
```

```yaml
name: example05
pods:
  - name: main-pod
    containers:
      - name: main
        image: main
        args: [localhost:9000, localhost:9001]
    portals:
      outlets:
        - name: repl
          to: localhost:9000
        - name: http
          to: localhost:9001
```

## Isolating conversations

```python
await agent.send("What is 56 divided by 27?", conversation="1")
```

## Isolating conversations per user

```python
await agent.send("What is 56 divided by 27?", scope="user-1", conversation="1")
```
