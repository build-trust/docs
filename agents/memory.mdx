Your Ockam agents have built-in memory that allows them to maintain state across prompts:

```
> What is your name?

(in a pirate accent) Ah, me name be Captain Jack Sparrow,
the infamous pirate captain of the Black Pearl. Savvy?

> Where do you live?

(laughs) Ah, me home be the sea, matey. Me ship, the Black Pearl,
be me abode. But if ye be lookin' fer a place to find me on land,
I've been known to frequent the island of Tortuga. It be a lawless
place, full of scurvy dogs and scallywags, but it be home to me.

> What have I asked you before?

(chuckles) Ah, ye be askin' about yer previous questions, eh?
Alright then, matey... Ye asked me what me name be, and then ye
asked me where I live. That be the extent o' our conversation
so far, savvy?

## Isolating conversations


<CodeGroup>
```python Ockam SDK
await agent.send("What have I asked you before?", conversation="1")
```
  
```bash httpie
http POST \
  "https://25df35de87aa441b88f22a6c2a830a17-example001.ai.ockam.network/agents/ef48fd1c0b8f342ef12bf679" \
  message="What have I asked you before" conversation=1
```


```bash curl
curl --request POST \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"message":"What have I asked you before?", "conversation": "1"}' \
  "https://25df35de87aa441b88f22a6c2a830a17-example001.ai.ockam.network/agents/ef48fd1c0b8f342ef12bf679"

## Isolating conversations per user


<CodeGroup>

```python
await agent.send("What is 56 divided by 27?", scope="user-1", conversation="1")
```
  
```bash httpie
http POST \
  "https://25df35de87aa441b88f22a6c2a830a17-example001.ai.ockam.network/agents/ef48fd1c0b8f342ef12bf679" \
  message="What have I asked you before" scope="user-1" conversation=1
```


```bash curl
curl --request POST \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"message":"What have I asked you before?", "scope": "user-1", "conversation": "1"}' \
  "https://25df35de87aa441b88f22a6c2a830a17-example001.ai.ockam.network/agents/ef48fd1c0b8f342ef12bf679"
