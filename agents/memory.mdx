[{"content":"An LLC (Limited Liability Company) is a business structure that combines elements of both corporations and partnerships/sole proprietorships. Here are the key features of an LLC:\n\n1. Limited Liability Protection: Members (owners) are protected from personal liability for business debts and claims, meaning their personal assets are typically safe from business obligations.\n\n2. Flexible Tax Treatment: LLCs can choose how they want to be taxed:\n- As a sole proprietorship (single-member LLC)\n- As a partnership (multi-member LLC)\n- As a corporation (S-Corp or C-Corp)\n\n3. Flexible Management Structure:\n- Can be member-managed (owners run the business)\n- Can be manager-managed (hired professionals run the business)\n\n4. Less Formal Requirements:\n- Fewer recordkeeping and reporting requirements than corporations\n- More flexible operating agreements\n- Less rigid management structure\n\n5. Easy Formation:\n- File Articles of Organization with the state\n- Create an Operating Agreement\n- Obtain necessary permits and licenses\n\nBenefits include:\n- Personal asset protection\n- Tax flexibility\n- Less paperwork than corporations\n- Credibility with customers\n- Ability to have unlimited members (in most states)\n\nLLCs are popular among small business owners because they provide liability protection while maintaining operational flexibility and favorable tax treatment.","role":"assistant","tool_calls":[]}]%

[{"content":"# Trade Secrets Under U.S. Law\n\nUnder U.S. federal law, primarily the Defend Trade Secrets Act (DTSA) of 2016, a trade secret is defined as:\n\nInformation that:\n1. The owner has taken reasonable measures to keep secret\n2. Derives independent economic value (actual or potential) from not being generally known\n3. Cannot be readily ascertained by proper means by others who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use\n\nCommon examples of trade secrets include:\n- Customer lists\n- Manufacturing processes\n- Formulas (like the Coca-Cola recipe)\n- Business methods\n- Software algorithms\n- Marketing strategies\n\nUnlike patents, trademarks, or copyrights, trade secrets have no formal registration system and can theoretically last indefinitely as long as the information remains secret.\n\nState laws also protect trade secrets, with 48 states and the District of Columbia having adopted some version of the Uniform Trade Secrets Act (UTSA), which offers a similar definition.","role":"assistant","tool_calls":[]}]%
