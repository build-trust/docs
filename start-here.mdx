<Steps>
  <Step title="Get an account">
    [Sign up](https://ockam.io/signup) for an account with Ockam AI to create your new Cluster in Ockam AI.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install">
    Install the `ockam` command by running the following in your terminal.

    ```bash
    curl -sSfL install.command.ockam.io | bash && source "$HOME/.ockam/env"
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy your first agent">
    After that, run the `ockam` command to enroll your workstation as an administrator of your newly created Ockam AI Cluster.

    ```bash
    ockam
    ```

    This will generate an Ockam Identity for your workstation and store its secret keys in a file system based Ockam Vault. It will then ask you to authenticate with Ockam Orchestrator to make your workstation’s new Ockam Identity an administrator of your Cluster.

    Finally, the above command will download the code for a template `hello` app and create a production-ready deployment zone on our serverless runtime. Withing seconds, it will the put your first AI Agent into production and you can immediately start interacting with it.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Chat with your agent">
    The `hello` app includes an interactive [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) for interacting with your agent:

    ```
    Welcome to Ockam 👋
    
    You are connected to your agent - 25df35de87aa441b-hello-main-pod-main/66a48b60
    Ask it a question or give it a task.
    
    Type ':help' or ':h' to see this message again.
    Type ':quit' or ':q' to disconnect.
    
    >
    ```

    This agent runs on Ockam's serverless runtime.

    The REPL you access on your local machine runs in the cloud, and you connect to it over a secure & private connection using Ockam's messaging protocols.

  <Step title="Send">
    Type your instructions and press `[ENTER]` to interact with the agent:

## The generated code

Within the `hello` directory, `ockam` has created a new project with several files:

- An `ockam.yaml` configuration file that defines how your Zone should be deployed
- An `images` directory that contains the source code of docker images:
  - `main.py` - The Python code that powers your agent
  - `Dockerfile` - Instructions for building the agent's container

```bash Generated Files
» tree

├── ockam.yaml
└── images
    └── main
        ├── Dockerfile
        └── main.py
```

Let's examine these files:

```python images/main/Dockerfile
FROM ghcr.io/build-trust/ockam-python:latest
COPY . .
ENTRYPOINT ["python", "main.py"]
```

The `main.py` file contains the core logic for your agent. It uses Ockam's Python SDK to:

1. Create a node that can communicate using Ockam's messaging protocols
2. Start an agent with a specific prompt ("You are Jack Sparrow")
3. Launch a REPL (interactive shell) that connects to this agent

```python images/main/main.py
name: hello
pods:
  - name: main-pod
    containers:
      - name: main
        image: main
        args: [localhost:9000]
    portals:
      outlets:
        - to: localhost:9000
```

The `ockam.yaml` configuration file defines how to deploy your agent:

- Creates a zone named `hello`
- Creates a pod named `main-pod`
- Runs a container using the `main` image (built from your Python code)
- Sets up a portal outlet that will allow other nodes to communicate on port
  `9000`

```yaml ockam.yaml
from ockam import Agent, Node, Repl
from sys import argv


async def main(node):
    agent = await Agent.start(node, "You are Jack Sparrow.")
    await Repl.start(agent, argv[1])


Node.start(main)
```

When you run `ockam`, it:

1. Builds your Python code into a container image
2. Deploys the container according to the `ockam.yaml` configuration
3. Opens a portal inlet on your local workstation that connects to the outlet on the agent's container
4. Connects to the agent's REPL over the secure portal
