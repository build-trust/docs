<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an account">
    [Sign up](https://ockam.io/signup) for an account with Ockam AI to create your new Cluster.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install">
    Install `ockam` command by running the following in your terminal.

    ```bash
    curl -sSfL install.command.ockam.io | bash && source "$HOME/.ockam/env"
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy your first agent">
    <Note>
      Ensure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) installed and running on your workstation before running the `ockam` command.
    </Note>
    After that, create an empty directory and run `ockam` command to enroll your workstation as an administrator of your newly created Cluster in Ockam AI.

    ```bash
    mkdir hello && cd hello && ockam
    ```

    This will generate an Ockam Identity for your workstation and store its secret keys in a file system based Ockam Vault. It will then ask you to authenticate with Ockam Orchestrator to make your workstationâ€™s new Ockam Identity an administrator of your Cluster.

    ![Agent](/images/agent.svg)

    Finally, the above command will download the code for a template `hello` app and create a production-ready deployment Zone in your Cluster on our serverless Runtime. Withing seconds, it will put your first AI Agent into production and you can immediately start interacting with it.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Chat with your agent">
    The `hello` app includes an interactive [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) for interacting with your agent:

    ```
    Welcome to Ockam ðŸ‘‹
    
    You are connected to your agent - 25df35de/66a48b60
    Ask it a question or give it a task.
    
    Type ':help' or ':h' to see this message again.
    Type ':quit' or ':q' to disconnect.
    
    >
    ```

    This agent is running on Ockam's serverless runtime.

    The REPL you access on your local machine runs in the cloud, and you connect to it over a secure & private connection using Ockam's messaging protocols.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Ask the agent something">
    Type your instructions and press `[ENTER]` to interact with the agent:

    ```
    > Who are you?
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### The generated code

Within the `hello` directory, `ockam` has created a new project with the following files:

```bash Generated Files
Â» tree

â”œâ”€â”€ ockam.yaml
â””â”€â”€ images
    â””â”€â”€ main
        â”œâ”€â”€ Dockerfile
        â””â”€â”€ main.py
```

Within the `hello` directory, `ockam` has created a new project with the following files:

- The `ockam.yaml` configuration file defines how to deploy your zone.
- The `images` directory contains the source code of docker images.
  - Inside it, there is a directory for the `main` image.
    - `Dockerfile` describe how the main image will be compiled.
    - `main.py` is the Python program that is run by the main image.

Let's examine each file:

```yaml ockam.yaml
name: hello
pods:
  - name: main-pod
    containers:
      - name: main
        image: main
        args: [localhost:9000]
    portals:
      outlets:
        - to: localhost:9000
```

The `ockam.yaml` configuration file defines how to deploy your agent:

- Create a zone named `hello` .
- Create a pod named `main-pod`inside the `hello` zone.
- Run a `main` container using the `main` image.
- Set up a portal outlet that will allow other nodes to reach `localhost:9000` in this pod.

```bash images/main/Dockerfile
FROM ghcr.io/build-trust/ockam-python:latest
COPY . .
ENTRYPOINT ["python", "main.py"]
```

The `Dockerfile` bases the `main` image on the `ockam-python` image with already contains the `ockam` python package. The `Dockerfile` then copies the contents of the `images/main` directory into the image and runs the `main.py` python program.

```python images/main/main.py
from ockam import Agent, Node, Repl
from sys import argv


async def main(node):
    agent = await Agent.start(node, "You are Jack Sparrow.")
    await Repl.start(agent, argv[1])


Node.start(main)
```

`main.py` file contains the core logic for your app. It uses the `ockam` python package to:

1. Start a Node that will invoke the `main` function after initialization.
2. The main function start an agent on that node with a specific prompt ("You are Jack Sparrow").
3. It then starts a REPL (interactive shell) server that for that agent.

```Output
    Deploying zone hello in cluster 25df35de87aa441b88f22a6c2a830a17...

  âœ” Created a repository for the image main
  âœ” Built image main
  âœ” Pushed image main

  âœ” Deployed zone hello in cluster 25df35de87aa441b88f22a6c2a830a17

  âœ” Opened a portal to the outlet main-pod on main-pod from tcp://localhost:9000
  âœ” Opened a portal to the outlet http on main-pod from tcp://localhost:8000
  âœ” Opened a portal to the outlet logs on logs-pod from tcp://localhost:3000
```

When you run `ockam`, it:

1. Builds the code in `images/main` into a container image and pushes that image to your Zone.
2. Deploys the Zone into your Cluster based on the configuration in `ockam.yaml` .
3. Opens a portal inlet on your local workstation that connects to the outlet in the `main-pod` .
4. Connects to the agent's REPL over this private and secure portal.
