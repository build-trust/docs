<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign Up">
    (Sign up)[ockam.io/signup] for an account with Ockam AI to create your new Cluster in Ockam AI.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install">
    Install the `ockam` command by running the following in your terminal.

    ```bash
    curl -sSfL install.command.ockam.io | bash && source "$HOME/.ockam/env"
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy your first agent">
    After that, enroll your workstation as an administrator of your Cluster.

    ```bash
    ockam
    ```

    This will generate an Ockam Identity for your workstation and store its secret keys in a file system based Ockam Vault. It will then ask you to authenticate with Ockam Orchestrator to make your workstationâ€™s new Ockam Identity an administrator of your new Cluster.

    Finally, the above command will download the code for a template `hello world` app and create a production-ready deployment zone on our serverless runtime. Withing seconds, it will the put your first AI Agent into production and you can immediately start interacting with it.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Chat with your agent">
    The "hello world" app includes an interactive [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) for interacting with your agent:

    ```
    Welcome to Ockam ðŸ‘‹
    
    You are connected to your agent - 782844ce-hello-main/545107ca
    Ask it a question or give it a task.
    
    Type ':help' or ':h' to see this message again.
    Type ':quit' or ':q' to disconnect.
    
    > 
    ```

    This agent runs on Ockam's serverless runtime. The REPL you access on your local machine runs in the cloud, and you connect to it over a secure & private connection using Ockam's messaging protocols.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Send">
    Type your instructions and press `[ENTER]` to interact with the agent:

    ```
    > Tell me a tale
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## The generated code

Within the `hello` directory, `ockam` has created a new project with several files:

- A `README.md` with information about your project
- An `ockam.yaml` configuration file that defines how your agent should be deployed
- An `images` directory containing the agent's source code:
  - `main.py` - The Python code that powers your agent
  - `Dockerfile` - Instructions for building the agent's container
  - `requirements.txt` - Python package dependencies
  - `README.md` - Documentation specific to the agent implementation

```bash Generated Files

        â”œâ”€â”€ main.py
        â””â”€â”€ requirements.txt
```

Let's examine these files:

The `main.py` file contains the core logic for your agent. It uses Ockam's Python SDK to:

1. Create a node that can communicate using Ockam's messaging protocols
2. Start an agent with a specific prompt ("You are Jack Sparrow")
3. Launch a REPL (interactive shell) that connects to this agent

```python images/main/main.py
from ockam import Agent, Node, Repl
from sys import argv


async def main(node):
    agent = await Agent.start(node, "You are Jack Sparrow.")
    await Repl.start(agent, argv[1])


Node.start(main)
```

The `ockam.yaml` configuration file defines how to deploy your agent:

- Creates a zone named `hello`
- Creates a pod named `main-pod`
- Runs a container using the `main` image (built from your Python code)
- Sets up a portal outlet that will allow other nodes to communicate on port
  `9000`

```yaml ockam.yaml
name: hello
pods:
  - name: main-pod
    containers:
      - name: main
        image: main
        args: [localhost:9000]
    portals:
      outlets:
        - to: localhost:9000
```

When you run `ockam`, it:

1. Builds your Python code into a container image
2. Deploys the container according to the `ockam.yaml` configuration
3. Opens a portal inlet on your local workstation that connects to the outlet on the agent's container
4. Connects to the agent's REPL over the secure portal
